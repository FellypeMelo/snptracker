# Initial Concept

Existing detector of SNPs in DNA sequences.
# SNPTracker Product Guide

## Vision
SNPTracker is a high-precision tool for detecting and analyzing Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Indels in DNA sequences. It aims to bridge the gap between simple educational scripts and complex bioinformatic pipelines by providing accurate, detailed, and annotated variant reports through both a robust Python API and an intuitive web dashboard.

## Target Users
- **Medical Researchers:** For pharmacogenomics and clinical research.
- **Bioinformaticians:** For population studies and pipeline integration.
- **Educational Tool:** For students learning about genetic variations.

## Key Features
- **Precise Detection:** Base-by-base comparison identifying Transitions, Transversions, and Indels.
- **Bioinformatic Standards:** FASTA support implemented; FASTQ and industry-standard VCF export planned.
- **Functional Annotation:** Integration with external databases (dbSNP/Ensembl) to provide clinical context and gene information.
- **Dual Interface:** A Python library for developers and a Web Dashboard for visual analysis.

## Project Priority
**Accuracy & Detail:** While performance is important, the primary focus is on the precision of variant classification and the richness of the generated annotations.
